3. About
--------

citygml4j is a Java class library and API for facilitating work with the
OGC City Geography Markup Language (CityGML). It makes it easy to read,
process, and write CityGML datasets, and to develop CityGML-aware software
applications.

Feature list:
* Support for the GML encodings of CityGML 3.0, 2.0, and 1.0
* Support for CityGML specific subsets of GML 3.3, 3.2, and 3.1.1
* Support for the eXtensible Address Language (xAL)
* Support for user-defined CityGML Application Domain Extensions (ADE)

CityGML is a conceptual model for semantic 3D city and landscape models issued
by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). It defines the common feature types,
attributes, and relations for representing the real-world entities of cities
and landscapes such as buildings, bridges, tunnels, transportation objects,
city furniture, water bodies, vegetation, and terrain.

CityGML implemented as OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) application schema
to enable the storage and exchange of CityGML data. Further encodings besides
are anticipated and may be supported by citygml4j in the future.

CityGML is an international OGC standard and can be used free of charge.

* Java JRE or JDK >= @javaCompatibility@


5. How to use it
----------------

Simply put the @jar@ library file and its mandatory dependencies
from the "lib" folder on your classpath to start developing with citygml4j.
Have fun :-)

citygml4j is also available as Maven artifact: 

  <dependency>
    <groupId>@groupId@</groupId>
    <artifactId>@artifactId@</artifactId>
    <version>@version@</version>
  </dependency>

A collection of sample programs that demonstrate the use of the library are
provided in the "samples" folder. The sample programs are organized into
subfolders, each addressing a different use case of citygml4j.

Gradle tasks are provided to easily run the sample programs. Simply open a
shell environment, change to the "samples" folder and invoke the Gradle wrapper
using the fully qualified name of the Java class as task name. For example:

  > gradlew reading_citygml.SimpleReader
