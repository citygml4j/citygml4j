3. About
--------

!citygml4j.name! is a Java class library and API for facilitating work with the
City Geography Markup Language (CityGML). It makes it easy to read, process, and
write CityGML datasets, and to develop CityGML-aware software applications.

Feature list:
* Full support for CityGML version 2.0.0 and 1.0.0
  (read-only support for CityGML 0.4.0)
* Support for CityGML specific subset of GML 3.1.1
* Support for the eXtensible Address Language (xAL)
* Support for user-defined CityGML Application Domain Extensions (ADE)

CityGML is an open data model and XML-based format for the storage and exchange
of semantic 3D city models. It is an application schema for the Geography Markup
Language version 3.1.1 (GML3), the extendible international standard for spatial
data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the ISO TC211.
The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the
basic entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model.

CityGML is an international OGC standard and can be used free of charge.
