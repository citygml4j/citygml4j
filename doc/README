3. About
--------

citygml4j is a Java class library and API for facilitating work with the
City Geography Markup Language (CityGML). It makes it easy to read, process,
and write CityGML datasets, and to develop CityGML-aware software 
applications.

CityGML is a common information model for the representation of 3D urban 
objects. It is realized as an open data model and XML-based format for the 
storage and exchange of virtual 3D city models. 

CityGML is implemented as an application schema for the Geography Markup 
Language version 3.1.1 (GML3), the extendible international standard for 
spatial data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and 
the ISO TC211. CityGML is an official OGC Standard and can be used 
free of charge.
